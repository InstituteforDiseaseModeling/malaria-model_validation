    Build a demographics input file for the DTK using emod_api.
    Right now this function creates the file and returns the filename. If calling code just needs an asset that's fine.
    Also right now this function takes care of the config updates that are required as a result of specific demog settings. We do NOT want the emodpy-disease developers to have to know that. It needs to be done automatically in emod-api as much as possible.
    TBD: Pass the config (or a 'pointer' thereto) to the demog functions or to the demog class/module.
